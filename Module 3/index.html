               While it is summer and we love ice creams, just how many scoops can we afford to have day after day? But ice pops and cold desserts are 
				not the only solutions to the scorching heat. 
				In fact, nothing can really beat the satisfaction of downing an entire glass of fruit juice in one breath. Fresh, tasty and healthy, 
				fruity drinks are a good source of energy after a long day at work. By thinking outside the box, you can even turn the "boring" fruit
				juices into exciting fruity drinks that don't compromise your diet and health. You can also spruce up your drinks with herbs and spices 
				to add your special personal touch.
